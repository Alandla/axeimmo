## Overview

Hoox API uses a credit-based pricing system where you pay for what you use. Credits are consumed when generating videos, creating scripts, and performing other operations. This guide explains how credits work and how to optimize your costs.

## Credit System

### How Credits Work

<Card title="Pay-per-Use Model" icon="credit-card">
  Credits are consumed only when operations are performed:
  - **Video Generation**: Based on duration and features
  - **Script Generation**: Fixed cost per generation
  - **Export**: Included for API videos, charged for dashboard videos
</Card>

## Video Generation Costs

Video generation costs depend on several factors:

### Base Costs

    **5 credits** every 30 seconds
    
    - Text-to-speech generation
    - Basic video assembly
    - Standard quality output
    - 15 seconds buffer included
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="With Animation" icon="sparkles">
    **+5 credits per image**
    
    - AI-powered movement
    - Cinematic effects
    - Professional quality
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Detailed Cost Breakdown

| Feature | Cost |  Notes |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Base Generation** | 5 credits | Every 30 seconds (with 15s buffer) |
| **Image Animation** | +5 credits/image | Transform static images into videos |
| **Custom Media Processing** | Included | URL-based media integration |

### Cost Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Video">
    **Simple 60-second video**
    
    ```
    Base cost (60s): 10 credits
    (5 credits per 30s x 2 tranches)
    Total: 10 credits
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Premium Content">
    **60-second video with avatar + 3 animated images**
    
    ```
    Base cost (60s): 10 credits
    Image animation (3 × 5): +15 credits
    Total: 25 credits
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Script Generation Costs

Script generation has a separate, predictable cost structure:

| Feature | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Base Generation** | 0.1 credits per 60 seconds | AI-generated script |
| **Web Search** | +0.1 credits | Enhanced with real-time information |
| **URL Processing** | +0.1 credits per URL | Content extraction from provided URLs |

### Script Cost Examples

```python
# Basic script generation
{
    "prompt": "Create a video about renewable energy",
    "duration": 60
}
# Cost: 0.1 credits (1 x 60s tranche)

# Enhanced script with web search
{
    "prompt": "Create a video about renewable energy",
    "duration": 60,
    "webSearch": True,
    "urls": ["https://energy.gov/renewable"]
}
# Cost: 0.3 credits (0.1 base + 0.1 web search + 0.1 per URL)
```

## Export Costs

Export costs vary based on how the video was created, resolution, and avatar model:
