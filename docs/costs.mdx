## Overview

Hoox API uses a credit-based pricing system where you pay for what you use. Credits are consumed when generating videos, creating scripts, and performing other operations. This guide explains how credits work and how to optimize your costs.

## Credit System

### How Credits Work

<Card title="Pay-per-Use Model" icon="credit-card">
  Credits are consumed only when operations are performed:
  - **Video Generation**: Based on duration and features
  - **Script Generation**: Fixed cost per generation
  - **Export**: Included for API videos, charged for dashboard videos
  - **No Monthly Fees**: Pay only for actual usage
</Card>

### Credit Purchase

Credits can be purchased through:
- **API Dashboard**: Web interface for credit management
- **Automatic Top-up**: Set thresholds for automatic refills
- **Bulk Purchases**: Volume discounts for large credit packages
- **Enterprise Plans**: Custom credit allocations

## Video Generation Costs

    - Unlimited downloads (24h validity)
    
    *Export costs are included in generation price*
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dashboard-Generated Videos" icon="desktop" color="#f59e0b">
    **Paid Export**
    
    - Variable cost based on duration
    - ~25-50 credits per video
    - Format conversion may add cost
    - Each export consumes credits
    
    *Separate charge for each export*

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Efficient Video Planning

```python
def estimate_video_cost(script_length, use_avatar=False, animate_images=0, animation_mode="standard"):
    """Calculate estimated video generation cost"""
    
    # Estimate duration (roughly 150 words per minute for speech)
    words = len(script_length.split())
    duration_seconds = (words / 150) * 60
    
    # Base cost calculation
    base_cost = 30 + max(0, duration_seconds - 30)  # 30 credits for first 30s, 1 per additional second
    
    # Avatar cost
    avatar_cost = 20 if use_avatar else 0
    
    # Animation cost
    animation_cost = 0
    if animate_images > 0:
        cost_per_image = 25 if animation_mode == "pro" else 10
        animation_cost = animate_images * cost_per_image
    
    total_cost = base_cost + avatar_cost + animation_cost
    
    return {
        "estimated_duration": duration_seconds,
        "base_cost": base_cost,
        "avatar_cost": avatar_cost,
        "animation_cost": animation_cost,
        "total_cost": total_cost
    }

# Usage
script = "Welcome to our company. We provide innovative solutions for modern businesses..."
cost_estimate = estimate_video_cost(script, use_avatar=True, animate_images=2, animation_mode="standard")
print(f"Estimated cost: {cost_estimate['total_cost']} credits")
```

### 2. Batch Operations

Process multiple videos efficiently:

```python
def optimize_batch_generation(video_scripts, shared_settings):
    """Optimize costs for batch video generation"""
    
    total_estimated_cost = 0
    batch_plan = []
    
    for i, script in enumerate(video_scripts):
        # Use same avatar across batch to maintain consistency
        cost_estimate = estimate_video_cost(
            script, 
            use_avatar=shared_settings.get("use_avatar", False),
            animate_images=shared_settings.get("animate_images", 0),
            animation_mode=shared_settings.get("animation_mode", "standard")
        )
        
        batch_plan.append({
            "video_index": i,
            "script": script,
            "estimated_cost": cost_estimate["total_cost"]
        })
        
        total_estimated_cost += cost_estimate["total_cost"]
    
    return {
        "total_videos": len(video_scripts),
        "total_estimated_cost": total_estimated_cost,
        "average_cost_per_video": total_estimated_cost / len(video_scripts),
        "batch_plan": batch_plan
    }

# Usage
scripts = [
    "Introduction to our product features...",
    "How to get started with our platform...",
    "Advanced tips and tricks..."
]

batch_optimization = optimize_batch_generation(scripts, {
    "use_avatar": True,
    "animate_images": 1,
    "animation_mode": "standard"
})

print(f"Batch cost: {batch_optimization['total_estimated_cost']} credits")
print(f"Average per video: {batch_optimization['average_cost_per_video']:.1f} credits")
```

### 3. Smart Feature Usage

Choose features based on content value:

```python
def recommend_features_by_use_case(use_case, budget_tier="standard"):
    """Recommend cost-effective features for different use cases"""
    
    recommendations = {
        "internal_training": {
            "use_avatar": False,  # Voice-only to save costs
            "animate_images": 0,
            "web_search": False,
            "reasoning": "Focus on content over presentation for internal use"
        },
        "customer_facing": {
            "use_avatar": True,   # Professional appearance
            "animate_images": 1,  # Light animation for engagement
            "web_search": False,
            "reasoning": "Balance professional appearance with cost"
        },
        "marketing_campaign": {
            "use_avatar": True,
            "animate_images": 3,  # Higher engagement
            "animation_mode": "pro" if budget_tier == "premium" else "standard",
            "web_search": True,   # Current information
            "reasoning": "Maximize engagement for marketing ROI"
        },
        "social_media": {
            "use_avatar": True,
            "animate_images": 2,
            "animation_mode": "standard",  # Cost-effective animation
            "web_search": False,
            "reasoning": "Optimized for social media engagement"
        }
    }
    
    return recommendations.get(use_case, recommendations["customer_facing"])

# Usage
training_features = recommend_features_by_use_case("internal_training")
marketing_features = recommend_features_by_use_case("marketing_campaign", "premium")

print(f"Training recommendation: {training_features}")
print(f"Marketing recommendation: {marketing_features}")
```

## Credit Management

### Monitoring Usage

```python
def track_credit_usage():
    """Track and analyze credit consumption patterns"""
    
    # This would integrate with your actual API usage tracking
    usage_data = {
        "current_balance": 1250,
        "monthly_usage": 2100,
        "daily_average": 70,
        "top_cost_drivers": [
            {"feature": "Avatar usage", "credits": 800, "percentage": 38},
            {"feature": "Base generation", "credits": 900, "percentage": 43},
            {"feature": "Image animation", "credits": 300, "percentage": 14},
            {"feature": "Script generation", "credits": 100, "percentage": 5}
        ]
    }
    
    # Calculate efficiency metrics
    projected_monthly = usage_data["daily_average"] * 30
    efficiency_score = (usage_data["monthly_usage"] / projected_monthly) * 100
    
    print(f"Current balance: {usage_data['current_balance']} credits")
    print(f"Monthly usage: {usage_data['monthly_usage']} credits")
    print(f"Efficiency score: {efficiency_score:.1f}%")
    print("\nTop cost drivers:")
    for driver in usage_data["top_cost_drivers"]:
        print(f"- {driver['feature']}: {driver['credits']} credits ({driver['percentage']}%)")
    
    return usage_data

# Usage
usage_stats = track_credit_usage()

def calculate_video_roi(traditional_cost, api_cost, time_saved_hours, hourly_rate):
    """Calculate ROI of using Hoox API vs traditional methods"""
    
    time_savings_value = time_saved_hours * hourly_rate
    total_savings = traditional_cost - api_cost + time_savings_value
    roi_percentage = (total_savings / api_cost) * 100
    
    return {
        "traditional_cost": traditional_cost,
        "api_cost": api_cost,
        "time_savings_value": time_savings_value,
