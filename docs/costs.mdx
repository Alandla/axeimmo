## Overview

Hoox API uses a credit-based pricing system where you pay for what you use. Credits are consumed when generating videos, creating scripts, and performing other operations. This guide explains how credits work and how to optimize your costs.

## Credit System

### How Credits Work

<Card title="Pay-per-Use Model" icon="credit-card">
  Credits are consumed only when operations are performed:
  - **Video Generation**: Based on duration and features
  - **Script Generation**: Fixed cost per generation
  - **Export**: Included for API videos, charged for dashboard videos
</Card>

## Video Generation Costs

Video generation costs depend on several factors:

  <Tab title="Basic Video">
    **Simple 60-second video**
    
    ```
    Base cost (60s): 10 credits
    (5 credits per 30s x 2 tranches)
    Total: 10 credits

## Script Generation Costs

Script generation has a separate, predictable cost structure:

| Feature | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Base Generation** | 0.1 credits per 60 seconds | AI-generated script |
| **Web Search** | +0.1 credits | Enhanced with real-time information |
| **URL Processing** | +0.1 credits per URL | Content extraction from provided URLs |

### Script Cost Examples

```python
# Basic script generation
{
    "prompt": "Create a video about renewable energy",
    "duration": 60
}
# Cost: 0.1 credits (1 x 60s tranche)

# Enhanced script with web search
{
    "prompt": "Create a video about renewable energy",
    "duration": 60,
    "webSearch": True,
    "urls": ["https://energy.gov/renewable"]
}
# Cost: 0.3 credits (0.1 base + 0.1 web search + 0.1 per URL)
```

## Export Costs

API-generated videos include first export is free, included in the generation price.

### Recommended First Steps

1. **Test with simple content**: Start with basic videos to understand quality
2. **Experiment with features**: Try avatars and animations with small tests
3. **Monitor usage**: Track credit consumption patterns
4. **Scale gradually**: Increase feature usage based on results
