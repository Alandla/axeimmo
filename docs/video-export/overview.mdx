## What is Video Export?

Video export is the process of converting your generated video into a downloadable MP4 file. After video generation is complete, you use the export endpoints to create a final video file that you can download, share, or integrate into your applications.

## Export Process

The export process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Video Generation">
    Ensure your video generation is finished with `status: "completed"`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Export">
    Call `/export/start` with the `video_id` from generation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Poll `/export/status/{jobId}` to track export progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Video">
    Get the download URL when export status becomes `completed`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export Formats

You can export videos in different formats optimized for various platforms:

## Export Costs

### High Resolution Surcharge

Videos exported at resolutions exceeding 1080p (width > 1920px OR height > 1080px) incur an additional cost:

<Card title="High Resolution Cost" icon="expand">
  **+2.5 credits per 30 seconds**
  
  Applies when exporting at resolutions above 1080p (e.g., 4K, custom high-res formats).
  This surcharge is added to the base export cost.
</Card>

<Warning>
The high resolution surcharge applies to **all videos** (both API-generated and dashboard-created) when exporting at resolutions exceeding 1080p.
</Warning>

### Avatar Quality Models

When your video includes an avatar, you can choose from three quality models with different performance and cost characteristics:

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Premium" icon="gem">

  </Card>

    **Best for:**
    - Premium content
    - Flagship campaigns
    - Maximum quality requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Avatar costs are calculated based on **avatar visibility duration**, not total video duration. Only the segments where the avatar is visible are charged.
</Note>

### Cost Calculation Examples

**Example 1**: A 60-second API video at standard resolution with 40 seconds of Premium avatar:
- Base export cost: 0 credits (API video - included)
- High-res cost: 0 credits (≤1080p)
- Avatar cost: 40s × 0.5 = 20 credits
- **Total cost**: 20 credits

**Example 2**: A 60-second API video exported at 3840x2160 (4K):
- Base export cost: 0 credits (API video - included)
- High-res cost: 2 × 2.5 = 5 credits
- Avatar cost: 0 credits (no avatar)
- **Total cost**: 5 credits

**Example 3**: A 90-second dashboard video at 4K with 60 seconds of Premium avatar:
- Base export cost: 3 × 5 = 15 credits
- High-res cost: 3 × 2.5 = 7.5 credits
- Avatar cost: 60s × 0.5 = 30 credits
- **Total cost**: 52.5 credits
