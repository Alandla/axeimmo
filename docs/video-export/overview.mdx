## What is Video Export?

Video export is the process of converting your generated video into a downloadable MP4 file. After video generation is complete, you use the export endpoints to create a final video file that you can download, share, or integrate into your applications.

## Export Process

The export process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Video Generation">
    Ensure your video generation is finished with `status: "completed"`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Export">
    Call `/export/start` with the `video_id` from generation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Poll `/export/status/{jobId}` to track export progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Video">
    Get the download URL when export status becomes `completed`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export Formats

You can export videos in different formats optimized for various platforms:

    **Best for:**

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Avatar costs are calculated based on **avatar visibility duration**, not total video duration. Only the segments where the avatar is visible are charged.
</Note>

### Cost Calculation Example

For a 2-minute video with 45 seconds of avatar visibility using the Premium model:

- Base export cost: 10 credits (for 2-minute video)
- Avatar cost: 45 seconds Ã— 0.5 credits/sec = 22.5 credits
- **Total cost**: 32.5 credits
