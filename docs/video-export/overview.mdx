## What is Video Export?

Video export is the process of converting your generated video into a downloadable MP4 file. After video generation is complete, you use the export endpoints to create a final video file that you can download, share, or integrate into your applications.

## Export Process

The export process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Video Generation">
    Ensure your video generation is finished with `status: "completed"`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Export">
    Call `/export/start` with the `video_id` from generation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Poll `/export/status/{jobId}` to track export progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Video">
    Get the download URL when export status becomes `completed`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export Formats

You can export videos in different formats optimized for various platforms:

### Cost Calculation Examples

**Example 1**: A 60-second API video at standard resolution with 40 seconds of Premium avatar visibility:
- Base export cost: 0 credits (API video - included)
- High-res cost: 0 credits (≤1080p)
- Avatar cost: 40s × 0.5 = 20 credits
- **Total cost**: 20 credits

**Example 2**: A 60-second API video with 3 avatar segments using Veo 3 Fast:
- Base export cost: 0 credits (API video - included)
- High-res cost: 0 credits (≤1080p)
- Avatar cost: 3 segments × 8 seconds × 2.3 = 55.2 credits
- **Total cost**: 55.2 credits

**Example 3**: A 60-second API video exported at 3840x2160 (4K):
- Base export cost: 0 credits (API video - included)
- High-res cost: 2 × 2.5 = 5 credits
- Avatar cost: 0 credits (no avatar)
- **Total cost**: 5 credits

**Example 4**: A 90-second dashboard video at 4K with 60 seconds of Premium avatar visibility:
- Base export cost: 3 × 5 = 15 credits
- High-res cost: 3 × 2.5 = 7.5 credits
- Avatar cost: 60s × 0.5 = 30 credits (avatar visibility)
- **Total cost**: 52.5 credits
