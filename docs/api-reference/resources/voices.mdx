## Voice Categories

### System Voices
High-quality, professionally recorded voices available based on your plan:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Free Plan" icon="gift">
    3 basic voices
    English only
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start Plan" icon="rocket">
    15+ voices
    English + French
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pro Plan" icon="star">
    50+ voices
    Multiple languages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise" icon="building">
    All voices
    Custom voice cloning
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Custom Voices
Voices you've uploaded to your space:
- Voice cloning from audio samples
- Brand-specific voices
- Celebrity voice clones (with proper licensing)
- Multi-language custom voices

## Filtering Options

### By Language
```bash
# English voices
GET /resources/voices?language=en

# French voices  
GET /resources/voices?language=fr

# Spanish voices
GET /resources/voices?language=es
```

### By Gender
```bash
# Female voices only
GET /resources/voices?gender=female

# Male voices only
GET /resources/voices?gender=male
```

### By Tags
Common voice tags include:

- **Tone**: `professional`, `casual`, `friendly`, `authoritative`
- **Style**: `news`, `documentary`, `commercial`, `educational`
- **Quality**: `warm`, `clear`, `deep`, `energetic`
- **Special**: `custom`, `premium`, `ai-generated`

```bash
# Professional female voices
GET /resources/voices?gender=female&tags=professional

# Documentary-style voices
GET /resources/voices?tags=documentary,authoritative
```

## Usage in Video Generation

After selecting a voice, use its `id` in video generation:

```json
{
  "script": "Your video script here",
  "voice_id": "voice_en_us_female_sarah",
  "avatar_id": "avatar_business_woman_1"
}
```

## Voice Preview

Each voice includes a `preview` URL with a short audio sample. Use this to:

1. **Test voice quality** before generation
2. **Compare different voices** for your content
3. **Share with clients** for approval

```javascript
// Play voice preview
const audio = new Audio(voice.preview);
audio.play();
```

## Plan Limitations

Voice availability depends on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Available Voices | Languages | Custom Voices |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Free | 3 basic voices | English only | ❌ |
| Start | 15+ voices | English, French | ❌ |
| Pro | 50+ voices | 10+ languages | ✅ |
| Enterprise | All voices | All languages | ✅ Unlimited |

## Best Practices

### 1. Voice Selection
- **Match tone to content**: Professional for business, casual for social media
- **Consider your audience**: Local accents for regional content
- **Test with short clips**: Generate a short video to test voice quality

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Cache voice lists**: Store voice data locally to reduce API calls
- **Filter client-side**: Use query parameters to get only needed voices
- **Preload previews**: Load voice previews for better user experience

### 3. Error Handling
```python
def get_suitable_voice(language="en", gender="female"):
    """Get a suitable voice with fallback options"""
    try:
        # Try with specific filters
        response = requests.get(
            f"{API_BASE}/resources/voices",
            params={"language": language, "gender": gender},
            headers=headers
        )
        voices = response.json()['voices']
        
        if voices:
            return voices[0]['id']  # Return first match
        
        # Fallback to any voice in the language
        response = requests.get(
            f"{API_BASE}/resources/voices",
            params={"language": language},
            headers=headers
        )
        voices = response.json()['voices']
        
        if voices:
            return voices[0]['id']
            
        # Ultimate fallback to first available voice
        response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/resources/voices", headers=headers)
        voices = response.json()['voices']
        return voices[0]['id'] if voices else None
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error getting voice: {e}")
        return None
```
