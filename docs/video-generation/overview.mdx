## How Video Generation Works

The Hoox API uses advanced AI to generate videos from various inputs:

1. **Content Creation**: From prompts, scripts, or existing media
2. **Voice Synthesis**: Convert text to natural-sounding speech
3. **Visual Assembly**: Combine media, animations, and transitions
4. **Final Rendering**: Export in your desired format

  <Step title="Content Analysis">
    The AI analyzes your input (prompt, script, or media) to understand the content and requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Script Generation">
    If you provided a prompt, the AI generates a complete script with proper pacing and structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voice Synthesis">
    Text is converted to natural speech using your selected voice, with proper emphasis and timing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Media Selection">
    Relevant images and videos are found through web search or stock libraries to illustrate your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visual Assembly">
    All elements are combined with transitions, effects, and synchronization to create the final video.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cost Factors

Video generation costs depend on several factors:

| Factor | Base Cost | Additional Cost |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Basic generation | 1 credit | - |
| Script length | +1 credit | Per 1000 characters |
| Avatar usage | +2 credits | - |
| Image animation (standard) | +2 credits | Per image |
| Image animation (pro) | +5 credits | Per image |
| Web search | +1 credit | Per search query |

<Tip>
