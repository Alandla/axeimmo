## How Video Generation Works

The Hoox API uses advanced AI to generate videos from various inputs:

1. **Content Creation**: From prompts, scripts, or existing media
2. **Voice Synthesis**: Convert text to natural-sounding speech
3. **Visual Assembly**: Combine media, animations, and transitions
4. **Final Rendering**: Export in your desired format

## Input Options

### Text Content

Generate videos using text-based inputs. These options are perfect when you want the AI to handle voice synthesis and media selection automatically.

#### Prompt

Provide a simple text prompt and let the AI create everything from scratch - script, media selection, and voice synthesis. Perfect for quick content creation.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create an educational video about renewable energy sources, focusing on solar and wind power",
  "voice_id": "en-US-JennyNeural"
}
```

#### Script

Provide your own detailed script and let the AI handle voice synthesis and media selection. Ideal when you want control over the narrative but need help with production.

```json
{
  "script": "Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources. It harnesses the power of the sun through photovoltaic cells...",
  "voice_id": "en-US-AriaNeural",
}
```

### Media Content

Use your own media assets as the foundation for video generation. These options give you more control over the visual and audio elements of your videos.

#### Voice Recording

Use your own voice recordings as the audio track.

```json
{
  "voice_url": "https://your-domain.com/voiceover.mp3"
}
```

#### Avatar Video

Start with an existing avatar video where someone is speaking.

```json
{
  "avatar_url": "https://your-domain.com/avatar-speaking.mp4"
}
```

#### Custom Media

The AI will automatically analyze and place your media throughout the video based on the content.

```json
{
  "prompt": "A vide oabout my product",
  "voice_id": "en-US-DavisNeural",
  "media_urls": [
    "https://your-domain.com/product-shot.jpg",
    "https://your-domain.com/demo-video.mp4"
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Web Search Integration

Enhance your videos with real-time web content. The AI can search the internet during script writing to include current information, or find relevant images like celebrity photos, landmarks, content to enrich your video.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Explain cryptocurrency basics",
  "voice_id": "en-US-JennyNeural",
  "webSearch": {
    "script": true,    // Enhance script with web research
    "images": true     // Find relevant images automatically
  }
}
```

### Image Animation

Transform static images into dynamic videos using AI animation. Images from URLs are automatically converted into animated sequences, bringing still photos to life with natural movement and transitions.

```json
{
  "script": "The landscape shows beautiful mountains...",
  "voice_id": "en-US-AriaNeural",
  "animate_image": true,
  "animate_mode": "pro",        // Higher quality animation
  "animate_image_max": 3        // Limit for cost control
}
```

<Tip>
  Use the `animate_image_max` parameter to control animation costs when using many images.
</Tip>

### Workspace Media Control

Control how workspace media is used:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a company overview video",
  "voice_id": "en-US-DavisNeural",
  "use_space_media": false,      // Don't use workspace media
  "save_media_to_space": false   // Don't save generated media
}
```
