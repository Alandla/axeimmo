## How Script Generation Works

The Hoox Script Generation API creates compelling video scripts using AI-powered text generation:

1. **Content Analysis**: Process your prompt and any provided URLs
2. **Web Enhancement**: Optionally search the web for additional context
3. **Script Creation**: Generate natural, engaging scripts tailored to your duration
4. **Image Extraction**: Extract relevant images from web sources for visual elements

## Result

The API returns a generated script along with cost information and extracted images when URLs are provided.

  ]
}
```

### Image Extraction

When you provide URLs in your request, the system automatically extracts relevant images from those web pages. These extracted image URLs are returned in the `extractedImages` array.

**Why is this useful?** You can directly pass these extracted image URLs to the [Video Generation API](/api-reference/generation/start) using the `media_urls` parameter. This automatically incorporates the images from your source URLs into the generated video, creating a seamless content workflow.

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

#### Prompt
Your main instruction describing what the script should be about. Be specific about the tone, target audience, and key points you want covered.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create an educational script about artificial intelligence that explains its benefits and challenges for everyday users."
}
```

### Optional Parameters

#### Duration
Target script length in seconds (10-600). Defaults to 60 seconds.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a comprehensive overview of renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.",
  "duration": 180
}
```

#### URLs
Array of web sources to incorporate into your script (max 10 URLs). The system automatically scrapes and analyzes these URLs without needing to enable web search.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a compelling product presentation for our new smartwatch collection, highlighting the innovative health tracking features and battery life.",
  "urls": [
    "https://company.com/smartwatch-specs",
    "https://company.com/health-features"
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  URLs are processed automatically - you don't need to enable `webSearch` for URL content extraction.
</Tip>

#### Web Search
Enable additional web research to enhance script content with current information.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create an informative script covering the latest developments in artificial intelligence",
  "webSearch": true
}
```
