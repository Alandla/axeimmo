## What is Script Generation?

The Hoox Script Generation API allows you to create compelling video scripts using AI-powered text generation. This service can incorporate content from web sources, analyze multiple URLs, and generate scripts tailored to specific durations and requirements.

## Key Features

### üß† AI-Powered Script Generation
Generate natural, engaging scripts from simple prompts using advanced language models.

### üåê Web Content Integration
Automatically extract and incorporate content from provided URLs to enrich your scripts with real-world information.

### üñºÔ∏è Image Extraction
Extract relevant images from web content that can be used as visual elements in your videos.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Duration Control
Specify exact script duration to match your video requirements (10-600 seconds).

### üí∞ Transparent Pricing
Clear credit-based pricing with upfront cost calculation.

## How It Works

1. **Provide a Prompt**: Start with a clear description of what you want your script to be about
2. **Add URLs (Optional)**: Include web sources to incorporate specific information
3. **Set Duration**: Specify how long you want the final script to be
4. **Generate**: The AI creates a comprehensive script incorporating all your requirements
5. **Get Results**: Receive the script, extracted images, and cost breakdown

## Use Cases

### Educational Content
Create informative scripts based on research articles, studies, or educational resources.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create an educational script about climate change",
  "duration": 180,
  "urls": [
    "https://climate.nasa.gov/facts/",
    "https://ipcc.ch/reports/"
  ]
}
```

### Marketing Content
Generate promotional scripts that incorporate product information from company websites.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a marketing script for our new eco-friendly product line",
  "urls": ["https://company.com/sustainability"],
  "webSearch": true
}
```

### News and Current Events
Create scripts based on current news articles and trending topics.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Summarize today's tech news in an engaging format",
  "duration": 120,
  "urls": [
    "https://techcrunch.com/latest-article",
    "https://theverge.com/trending"
  ]
}
```

## Cost Structure

The pricing is transparent and predictable:

- **Base Cost**: 0.1 credit per 60 seconds of script duration
- **Web Search**: +0.1 credit when enabled
- **URL Processing**: +0.1 credit per URL provided
- **Additional Services**: Image extraction and content analysis (included)

### Example Cost Calculation

For a 120-second script with 3 URLs and web search enabled:
- Base cost: (120/60) √ó 0.1 = 0.2 credits
- Web search: +0.1 credits  
- URLs: 3 √ó 0.1 = 0.3 credits
- **Total**: 0.6 credits

## Best Practices
